# HitchStory Examples

This repo contains four to do apps, each tested with
[HitchStory](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory), a
[StrictYAML based](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/strictyaml)
FOSS python integration testing framework.

Unlike other testing frameworks these terse, simple, type-safe stories can:

## Rewrite themselves based upon program output

All of the above tests are also running on Github Actions with [no tweaks](https://github.com/hitchdev/examples/blob/main/.github/workflows/regression.yml):

[![Example Tests Running on Github Actions](https://github.com/hitchdev/examples/actions/workflows/regression.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hitchdev/examples/actions/workflows/regression.yml)

## Run them yourself

**Podman must be installed on your system first.**

All other functionality is automated and can be run via one of the 
four key.sh scripts.

To begin:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hitchdev/examples.git
$ cd examples/commandlib -OR- restapi -OR- website -OR- pythonapi
$ ./key.sh make
```

This downloads and builds the container and python packages the
tests need to run in an isolated environment.


## Run all tests

```
$ ./key.sh regression
```

## Run a single test

This command can be used to craft a new feature and do
acceptance test driven development on it:

```
$ ./key.sh atdd correct
```

"correct" is a unique keyword used in the name of one of the stories.

## Run singular test in rewrite mode

If you tweak the wordings in the command line app and run this, it will
update the story accordingly.

```
$ ./key.sh ratdd correct
```

For the REST API project, it will rewrite the REST API responses. For the Python API project it will rewrite the expected output. For the website app, it retakes the screenshot and video.

Rewrite behavior is controlled from `engine.py` - see where `self._rewrite` is used to see how.

## Generate documentation from stories

This will regenerate all of the markdown docs for the project:

```
$ ./key.sh docgen
```

For the website project, the screenshots and video artefacts
used by the markdown can all be regenerated by running:

```
$ ./key.sh recordings
```

> **Warning**
>You might have to fork this project and push changes to preview the github-flavored markdown with videos and images.


## Clean up everything

When ./key.sh make is run on any of these 4 project, it will create one podman image and one volume
each. This command cleans them both up:

```
$ ./key.sh clean all
```


> **Note**
>It must be run in each project folder you ran ./key.sh make in.

# About the projects

The four folders contain four versions of the same project -
[this great little to do app](https://github.com/ovinokurov/ToDo)
built by [Oleg Vinokurov](https://github.com/ovinokurov) which was built
with a command line, REST and web interface.

For the pythonapi project everything is just run in the Hitch container (test and code-under-test in separate virtualenvs).

The interactive command line app and REST API have a podman-in-podman:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    HitchContainer-->AppContainer;
```

While the website app is tested with a parent hitch container building and running the app and playwright containers:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    HitchContainer-->AppContainer;
    HitchContainer-->PlaywrightContainer;
```

This is done to segregate the test code from the application code.


# Future work on this repo

- [ ] Integrate containerized postgres running with all of the apps, seeded with [given preconditions](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/using/given/).
- [ ] Mock the passage of time with a step - implement reminders into the to do apps.
- [ ] Handle a REST API response which returns a different UUID each time it is called.
- [ ] Demonstrate story inheritance (e.g. logging in story -> add todo) using all of the [currently documented inheritance features listed here](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/using/).

Have suggestions? What kind of gnarly integration tests would you find most interesting? Raise an issue if you have more ideas.
