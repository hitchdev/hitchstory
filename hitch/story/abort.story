Abort a story with ctrl-C:
  docs: aborting
  about: |
    When an in-progress story is hit with any of the
    following termination signals:

    * SIGTERM
    * SIGINT
    * SIGQUIT
    * SIGHUP

    Then it triggers the tear_down method of the
    engine.

    In practical terms this means that if you are running
    a series of stories, Ctrl-C should halt current execution,
    run tear_down and then not run any more stories.
  given:
    example.story: |
      Create files:
        steps:
          - Pause forever

      Should never run:
        steps:
          - Should not happen

      class Engine(BaseEngine):
          def pause_forever(self):
              psutil.Process().terminate()

          def should_not_happen(self):
              raise Exception("This exception should never be triggered")

          def tear_down(self):
              print("Reticulate splines")
