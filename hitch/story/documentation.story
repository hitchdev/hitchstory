    hitchstory YAML stories *are* designed to be readable, but also terse
    and easy to maintain.

    Where terseness and ease of maintenance trumps readability, the former
    take precedence. YAML stories are *not* intended to be a replacement for
    stakeholder documentation in and of themselves.

    YAML stories *are* designed, however, to be used to generate documentation
    for use by stakeholders.

    The example shown below demonstrates how a story can be transformed into
    markdown via jinja2. This markdown can then be used to generate HTML
    with a static site generator.
  given:
    documentation.jinja2: |
      {% for story in story_list %}
      {{ story.name }}
      {{ "-" * story.name|length }}

      {{ story.about }}

      {% for name, property in story.given.properties.items()  %}
      {{ property.documentation }}
      {% endfor %}
      {% for step in story.steps %}
      {{ step.documentation }}
      {% endfor %}
      {% endfor %}
