Flaky story detection:
  docs: flaky-story-detection
  about: |
    Dealing with flaky stories, especially with higher level integration tests
    is a constant battle.

    These examples show how flaky stories can be detected by rerunning stories
    several times and checking that the result is the same. This kind of regression
    testing can be usefully run separately from normal regression testing in order
    to get separate feedback about problematic tests in a 'flake' report.

    This cannot detect all kinds of flakiness, but it can be effective at detecting
    flakiness caused by, for example:

    * SELECT statements without an order by returning results in an arbitrary order.
    * Data structures with an indeterminate order (e.g. hash maps (python dicts)) being listed.
    * Stories that result in random numbers being generated and used.
    * Race conditions.
    * Web page responsiveness (e.g. a selenium click that is done too quickly).

    Note that a flakiness "pass" is simply about whether results are *consistent* - a story that
    fails consistently is considered passed, whereas a story that is run 99 times and fails once
    is considered a failure.
