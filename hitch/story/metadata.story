Extra story metadata - e.g. adding JIRA ticket numbers to stories:
  docs: metadata
  about: |
    Each and every story is related to issues on issue trackers,
    specialist documentation, people, external resources and much more.

    The best place to document this additional metadata is not buried in
    word documents on company wikis but within the story itself.

    What kind of metadata you add to stories is up to you -
    simply add the names of the properties you want to add
    in the info parameter of your engine InfoDefinition and
    specify the structure of the metadata using StrictYAML
    validators inside the InfoProperty object.

    This example shows how you can add a series of JIRA tickets
    and feature names as metadata on a story and filter stories
    to play by JIRA ticket number.
