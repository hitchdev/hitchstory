Inherit one story from another:
  docs: inheritance
  about: |
    You can break most software down into a series of
    individual linear behavioral stories.

    However, software stories naturally branch. In order to
    send an email or delete an email you must first always log
    in.

    While it would be possible to write out each individual
    story for every possible branch, this would result in a
    story suite that is WET instead of DRY and that creates
    a maintenance headache.

    Story inheritance allows you to base stories on other stories.

    The base story given preconditions and parameters will be
    used while the child story given preconditions will override
    them.

    The steps of the parent stories, if they have any steps,
    will be executed before the child story steps.
