# HitchStory

[![Main branch status](https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory/actions/workflows/regression.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory/actions/workflows/regression.yml)

HitchStory is a python 
[testing and living documentation framework](approach/testing-and-living-documentation) for building strictly typed [executable specifications](approach/executable-specifications) which can [auto-generate your howto documentation](approach/triality).

The executable specifications can be written to specify, test and document applications at every level - replacing [xUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) equivalents of unit tests, integration tests and end to end tests with appropriate tooling.

The specifications are written using [StrictYAML](why/strictyaml).



## Example







example.story:

```yaml
Logged in:
  given:
    website: /login  # preconditions
  steps:
  - Form filled:
      username: AzureDiamond
      password: hunter2
  - Clicked: login


Email sent:
  about: |
    The most basic email with no subject, cc or bcc
    set.
  based on: logged in             # inherits from and continues from test above
  following steps:
  - Clicked: new email
  - Form filled:
      to: Cthon98@aol.com
      contents: |                # long form text
        Hey guys,

        I think I got hacked!
  - Clicked: send email
  - Email was sent
```
engine.py:

```python
from hitchstory import BaseEngine, GivenDefinition, GivenProperty
from mockemailchecker import email_was_sent
from mockselenium import Webdriver
from strictyaml import Str

class Engine(BaseEngine):
    given_definition = GivenDefinition(
        website=GivenProperty(Str()),
    )

    def set_up(self):
        self.driver = Webdriver()
        self.driver.visit(
            "http://localhost:5000{0}".format(self.given['website'])
        )

    def form_filled(self, **textboxes):
        for name, contents in sorted(textboxes.items()):
            self.driver.fill_form(name, contents)

    def clicked(self, name):
        self.driver.click(name)

    def email_was_sent(self):
        email_was_sent()
```






```python
>>> from hitchstory import StoryCollection
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> from engine import Engine
>>>

## Design decisions and principles

Design decisions are justified here:

- [Declarative User Stories](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/declarative)
- [Why does hitchstory mandate the use of given but not when and then?](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/given-when-then)
- [Why is inheritance a feature of hitchstory stories?](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/inheritance)
- [Why does hitchstory not have an opinion on what counts as interesting to "the business"?](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/interesting-to-the-business)
- [Why does hitchstory not have a command line interface?](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/no-cli)
- [Principles](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/principles)
- [Why programatically rewrite stories?](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/rewrite)
- [Why does HitchStory use StrictYAML?](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/strictyaml)


## Why not X instead?

There are several tools you can use instead, this is why you should use this one instead:

- [Why not use Behave, Lettuce or Cucumber (Gherkin)?](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why-not/gherkin)
- [Why not use the Robot Framework?](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why-not/robot)
- [Why use hitchstory instead of a unit testing framework?](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why-not/unit-test)
