title: What is the difference betweeen a test and a story?
---

While a test is *turing complete* code that tests behavior, a
story is turing-incomplete code which *defines* behavior. A combination
of stories makes up an [executable specification](../executable-specifications)

A story must be played using an execution engine.

A story can be translated into readable documentation, often with
the aid of artefacts created when running the story (e.g.
screenshots).
