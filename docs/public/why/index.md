title: Design Justifications
---

HitchStory is the result of some carefully considered, although
controversial design decisions. These are justified here.

- [Principles]()
- [Two Unit Tests, Zero Integration Tests]()
- [Declarative User Stories]()
- [Why is inheritance a feature of hitchstory stories?]()
- [Why does hitchstory not have an opinion on what counts as interesting to "the business"?]()
- [Why programatically rewrite stories?]()
- [Why does HitchStory use StrictYAML?]()
- [Why does hitchstory mandate the use of given but not when and then?]()
- [Why does hitchstory not have a command line interface?]()
