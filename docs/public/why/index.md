- [Why does hitchstory mandate the use of given but not when and then?](given-when-then)
- [Why is inheritance a feature of hitchstory stories?](inheritance)
- [Why does hitchstory not have an opinion on what counts as interesting to "the business"?](interesting-to-the-business)
- [Why does hitchstory not have a command line interface?](no-cli)
- [Principles](principles)
- [Why programatically rewrite stories?](rewrite)
- [Why does HitchStory use StrictYAML?](strictyaml)


Rebuttals and critiques, especially from users and designers of 
competing tools are welcome. Either raise a ticket on github
or open a pull request with a link.
