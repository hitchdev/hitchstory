title: Why not X?

There are a number of other ways of testing and documenting which might seem
very similar to hitchstory. I have tried to document how they differ and
why I chose hitchstory's approach here:

- [Why use Hitchstory instead of Behave, Lettuce or Cucumber (Gherkin)?](gherkin)
- [Why not use the Robot Framework?](robot)
- [Why use hitchstory instead of a unit testing framework?](unit-test)


If you'd like to write or link to a rebuttal to any argument raised
here or ask for a comparison to something not listed here,
