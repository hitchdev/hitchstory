{{{{ intro.txt }}}}

HitchStory is a [StrictYAML](why/strictyaml) based python integration testing framework where the tests can [rewrite themselves](why/rewrite) and [write your docs](approach/triality).

[![Test rewriting itself](https://hitchdev.com/images/video-thumb.png)](https://vimeo.com/822561823 "Test rewriting itself")

It can be used to quickly and easily integration test and generate docs for any kind of app. Examples:

* [A website](https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory/tree/master/examples/website)
* [An interactive command line app](https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory/tree/master/examples/commandline)
* [A REST API](https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory/tree/master/examples/restapi)
* [A Python API](https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory/tree/master/examples/pythonapi)
