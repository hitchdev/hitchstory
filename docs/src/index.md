HitchStory is a python 
[testing and living documentation framework](approach/testing-and-living-documentation) for building strictly typed [executable specifications](approach/executable-specifications) which can [auto-generate your howto documentation](approach/triality).

The executable specifications can be written to specify, test and document applications at every level - replacing [xUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) equivalents of unit tests, integration tests and end to end tests with appropriate tooling.

The specifications are written using [StrictYAML](why/strictyaml).
